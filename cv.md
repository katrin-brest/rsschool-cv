## About me:
Now I'm a student of RSSchool JS/FE and my goal is to do my best in studying HTML, CSS and JS and become a true Frontend-developer in near future.

I have no experience of working in IT. I'm an economist and accountant by profession. But I strive to change my life radically and capable of fast learning.

**My strong points:** desire for new knowledge; responsibility; self-reliance; self-organization; constant work at self-improvement; ability to make decisions; command work; non-conflict.
